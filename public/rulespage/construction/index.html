					<h1>Sand Point Maintenance Commission Construction Approval Process</h1>
				
				
					









	
		<p>Welcome to the Sand Point Country Club! We are glad you have decided to locate your family in this unique neighborhood.</p>

<p>Because this is a private development, there are certain restrictions on Residential Construction Projects that you will not find in the Zoning or Building Codes of the City of Seattle. The enforcement of the Bylaws and Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&amp;R’s) rests with the Board of Directors of the Sand Point Maintenance Commission (SPMC). A guiding principle for the Board is that it acts in what it considers to be the best interests of the Sand Point Community. In matters such as construction projects that require a formal vote of the Board, this is determined by a majority of a quorum of the Board members present when the voting occurred. The Board’s authority is spelled out in this document, which contains excerpts from our Bylaws and CC&amp;R’s. In addition to the Sand Point Community’s requirements for construction projects, you also must apply to the City of Seattle for your building permits and comply with the city building codes.</p>

<p>If you are contemplating a construction project, please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the process outlined herein so that your project can go as smoothly as possible.</p>

	

				
					
	<a class="anchor" id="approval-process"></a>
	<h2>Approval Process</h2>










	
		<p>The SPMC Bylaws and CC&amp;R’s provide that:</p>

<ol>
<li>No building shall be erected, maintained or permitted upon any of said tracts except single, detached, private dwelling house, for the sole use of the owners or occupants thereof, for private residence purposes together with appurtenant garage.</li>
<li>No building, fence, wall or structure shall be erected, altered or maintained upon any of said tracts, unless plans and specifications therefor, showing the construction, nature, kind, shape, height, material and color scheme therefor, and block plan indicating the location of such structure on the building site and, when specifically requested, the grading plans of the building site, to be built upon, shall have been submitted to, and approved in writing by the said Commission, and a copy of such plans and specifications, block plan (and grading plan if requested) as finally approved, deposited for permanent record with the said Commission.</li>
<li>The Board of Directors&hellip; shall have, among others, the following powers &hellip; to interpret and enforce any and all protective restrictions, conditions, covenants, and reservations imposed upon any of said tracts by either of such owners&hellip;</li>
</ol>

<p>The CC&amp;R’s require that the Board must review, consider and approve or disapprove all proposed construction projects. In order for the Board to approve the construction project, you must submit the attached “Application for Approval of Construction” form along with a set of construction documents, to the Board’s Building Commissioner no less than thirty (30) days prior to the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting.</p>

<p>For simple construction projects that will not alter an existing roofline of a structure (e.g. the addition of a deck, minor interior modifications, etc.), the proposed project will typically be reviewed and a determination made by the Board at the first regularly scheduled Board meeting following receipt of the required documentation.</p>

<p>If a construction project will alter the existing roofline of a structure, the particular steps and time requirements for approval are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ridge Poles:</strong> Erect ridge poles to represent the height of the new structure. Ridge poles must be in place for a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the SPMC Board meeting at which the plans will be submitted for approval (the “_Approval Meeting_”).</li>
<li><strong>City Approval:</strong> Submit plans to the City of Seattle. Plans must have been submitted for the permit process prior to providing plans to the SPMC Building Commissioner (Step 4, below).</li>
<li><strong>Neighbor Contact:</strong> Contact each adjacent neighbor (all sides) and present plans and form for signature. Neighbors must be contacted at least twenty-five (25) days prior to the Approval Meeting. Contact may be made in person, by mail or by e-mail. The plans and signature form must be included in the mailing or the e-mail. If unable to contact a neighbor, document the attempt by sending a certified letter containing the plans and forms.</li>
<li><strong>SPMC Application:</strong> Fill out, sign and return SPMC construction application forms. Forms are available from the SPMC Building Commissioner. The SPMC Building Commissioner must receive the plans, signed application and signed neighbor forms a minimum of twenty (20) days prior to the Approval Meeting. If a neighbor does not return the signature form to the applicant and no written objection is received, the Board will consider the lack of the signed document as an approval.</li>
<li><strong>Objections:</strong> If a homeowner objects to the proposed construction plan, they must do so in writing to the SPMC Building Commissioner not less than ten (10) days prior to the Approval Meeting. Should any such written objection be received, the Board will consider the plans and objection at the Approval Meeting but will delay voting to approve or deny the plans until the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting. The applicant may respond in writing, submitted to the Board and all objecting homeowners no later than ten (10) days prior to the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, and submit any additional information or documentation in support of the application as well as their opinion as to what is in the best interest of the community.</li>
<li><strong>Plan Changes:</strong> SPMC Board approvals are limited to the particular construction plans submitted to the neighbors and Board. If the submitted plans are ultimately changed, either due to City of Seattle requirements or otherwise, the revised plans must be promptly re- submitted to the SPMC Building Commissioner. Depending on the nature and scope of the changes, re-approval by the SPMC Board and/or neighbors may be required.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the Approval Meeting, the Board shall allow the applicant and the objecting homeowners a reasonable opportunity to orally explain their project and/or objections. If the Board believes its decision may be based on matters not addressed by the parties in their written materials or oral comments, the Board shall so advise the parties and allow them a reasonable opportunity to respond. The Board may delay its decision for approval or rejection if it deems additional documentation is required from the applicant and/or objecting homeowners. Otherwise the Board shall vote at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting to approve or deny the application.</p>

<p>The Board shall document its decision which shall be reasonable and in good faith. The decision shall rest in the sound discretion of the Board.</p>

	

				
					
	<a class="anchor" id="construction-project-fee"></a>
	<h2>Construction Project Fee</h2>










	<p>A <strong>Construction Project Fee</strong> will be collected for any new construction or altered roofline projects when the Application for Approval of Construction is submitted. The fee will be deposited to the SPMC Reserve Account. Checks should be payable to the Sand Point Maintenance Commission.\n\n</p>

<ol>
<li>For projects where the existing house is demolished and new construction takes place, the fee is $1500.00.</li>
<li>For projects where the existing structure is modified by adding new exterior walls and/or changing the existing roofline, the fee is $750.00.</li>
</ol>


				
					
	<a class="anchor" id="additional-construction-rules"></a>
	<h2>Additional Construction Rules</h2>










	
		<p>Additions to the Construction Approval Process as approved by the Sand Point Maintenance Commission October 19, 1999 and amended May 15, 2001, March 15, 2012, May 19, 2016, and September 28, 2016:</p>

<ol>
<li>Construction is limited to the hours of 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday thru Friday and 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Saturday and Sunday.</li>
<li>Construction debris on the road must be cleaned on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Storm drains must be covered with filter fabric and kept free of debris.</li>
<li>Fencing or barricades on new construction projects must be five feet in height and shall be sited three feet in from where the asphalt meets the yard or landscape. Fencing or barricades shall be of mesh fabric or chain link. The fencing shall enclose the site such that it shall be secured from intrusion.</li>
<li>Homeowners are responsible for immediate repairs for damages to SPMC property as a result of their construction project.</li>
<li>Dumpsters are to remain on the property, not on the street. Under extenuating circumstances and with prior written approval by the SPMC Board, the dumpster may be allowed to be parked on the street for a period of no more than two weeks.</li>
<li>Where a new lateral sewer line connection is made into the main sewer line, it must be done in a professional manner such that the lateral does not protrude into the main line and the owners shall provide video or photographic evidence of such.</li>
<li>Temporary facilities including portable toilets are to be placed away from the street behind the fencing or barricade so as not to cause an unsightly appearance.</li>
<li>Curbs are to be constructed to City Code.</li>
<li>For projects where the existing house is demolished (1) pest abatement must take place prior to demolition and (2) contractor/owner shall make every effort to contain dust, to include sprinkler or spraying of water.</li>
<li>The level of illumination for exterior lighting shall not result in glare or levels of brightness which the Board determines may affect neighbors or persons traveling on the streets in the community. Because the level of illumination and the impact of lights on other properties is difficult to evaluate in advance of actual construction, the Board shall retain the authority, after installation of the feature, to require that illumination be modified to mitigate impacts on the other properties and persons.</li>
