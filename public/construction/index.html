			<h1>Sand Point Maintenance Commission Construction Approval Process</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the Sand Point Country Club!  We are glad you have decided to locate your family in this unique neighborhood.</p>
			<p>Because this is a private development, there are certain restrictions on Residential Construction Projects that you will not find in the Zoning or Building Codes of the City of Seattle.  The enforcement of the Bylaws and Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC & R’s) rests with the Sand Point Maintenance Commission’s Board of Directors.  A guiding principle for the Board is that it acts in what it considers to be the best interests of the Sand Point Community.  In matters such as construction projects that require a formal vote of the Board, this is determined by a majority of a quorum of the Board members present when the voting occurred.  The Board’s authority is spelled out in this document, which contains excerpts from our Bylaws and CC & R’s.  In addition to the Sand Point Community’s requirements for construction projects, you also must apply to the City of Seattle for your building permits and comply with the city building codes.</p>
			<p>If you are contemplating a Residential Construction Project, please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the process outlined herein so that your project can go a smoothly as possible.  The Bylaws and CC & R’s provide that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>No building shall be erected, maintained or permitted upon any of said tracts except single, detached, private dwelling house, for the sole use of the owners or occupants thereof, for private residence purposes together with appurtenant garage.</p></li>
				<li><p>No building, fence, wall or structure shall be erected, altered or maintained upon any of said tracts, unless plans and specifications therefor, showing the construction, nature, kind, shape, height, material and color scheme therefor, and block plan indicating the location of such structure on the building site and, when specifically requested, the grading plans of the building site, to be built upon, shall have been submitted to, and approved in writing by the said Commission, and a copy of such plans and specifications, block plan (and grading plan if requested) as finally approved, deposited for permanent record with the said Commission.</p></li>
				<li><p>The Trustees ... shall have, among others, the following powers ... to interpret and enforce any and all protective restrictions, conditions, covenants, and reservations imposed upon any of said tracts by either of such owners...</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The CC&R’s require that the Board must review, consider and approve or disapprove all proposed construction projects.  In order for the Board to approve the construction project, you must submit the attached “Application for Approval of Construction” form along with a set of construction documents, to the Board’s Building Commissioner no less than thirty (30) days prior to the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting.</p>
			<p>For simple construction projects that will not alter an existing roofline of a structure (e.g. the addition of a deck, minor interior modifications etc.)  The proposed project will typically be reviewed and a determination made by the Board at the first regularly scheduled Board meeting following receipt of the required documentation.</p>
			<p>If a construction project will alter the existing roofline of a structure, the applicant shall:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Provide a copy of the attached “Notice of Application for Project Approval Which Will Alter An Existing Roofline” to each adjacent homeowner (disregarding streets) not less than thirty (30) days prior to submission for approval to the Board by delivering or mailing the required notice.  If you choose to hand-deliver the notice, you must obtain the neighbor’s signature upon their receipt of the documents.  If mailing, you must send the required documentation by US Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, allowing enough time for the neighbor to receive the notice no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting.</p></li>
				<li><p>No later than twenty-four (24) days prior to the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting, the applicant shall also provide each adjacent neighbor the opportunity to review the construction documents.</p></li>
				<li><p>Erect a roof ridgepole or similar mechanism that reasonably and accurately displays the change in the existing roof ridgeline.  The roof ridgeline pole or similar mechanism shall be erected no less than thirty (30) days prior to submission of the project approval forms to the Board and shall not be removed until the Board has issued a notice of action to the applicant.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>At the first regularly scheduled Board meeting, the Board shall:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Determine if the applicant has timely provided notice to all adjacent homeowners;</li>
				<li>Determine if the plans for the proposed construction comply with the CC&R’s and Bylaws; and</li>
				<li>If the proposed project and plans alter an existing roofline, determine if the roof ridgepole or similar mechanism has been constructed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>During the first regularly scheduled Board meeting, if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board that none of the adjacent homeowners have any objections to the project and that the applicant has completed the items listed above, the Board may vote on the application at that time.</p>
			<p>If, however, any homeowner objects to the proposed project during or prior to the first regularly scheduled Board meeting, and the applicant has complied with items listed above, the Board shall continue consideration of the application to the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. In such event:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>All objecting homeowners must submit to the Board and the applicant, in writing, no less than twenty-four (24) days prior to the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, their objections and their opinion as to what is in the best interest of the community.</p></li>
				<li><p>The applicant may respond in writing, submitted to the Board and all objecting homeowners no later than ten (10) days prior to the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, to the objections and submit any additional information or documentation in support of the application as well as their opinion as to what is in the best interest of the community.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>During the Board meeting, the Board shall allow the applicant and the objecting homeowners a reasonable opportunity to orally explain their project and/or objections.  The Board shall complete the Board’s Project Review Checklist attached hereto.  If the Board believes its decision may be based on matters not addressed by the parties in their written materials or oral comments, the Board shall so advise the parties and allow them a reasonable opportunity to respond.  The Board may delay its decision for approval or rejection if it deems additional documentation is required from the applicant and/or objecting homeowners.  Otherwise the Board shall vote at the second meeting to approve or deny the application.</p>
			<p>The Board shall document its decision which shall be reasonable and in good faith. The decision shall rest in the sound discretion of the Board.</p>
			<p>Additions to the Construction Approval Process as approved by the Sand point Maintenance Commission October 19, 1999 and amended May 15, 2001 and March 15, 2012 and May 19, 2016</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Construction is limited to the hours of 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday    thru Friday and 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Saturday and Sunday.</li>

				<li>Homeowners are responsible for immediate repairs for damages to SPMC property as a result of their construction project.</li>
				<li>Dumpsters are to remain on the property, not on the street.  Under extenuating circumstances and with prior written approval by the SPMC Board, the dumpster may be allowed to be parked on the street for a period of no more than two weeks.</li>
				<li>Where a new lateral sewer line connection is made into the main sewer line, it must be done in a professional manner such that the lateral does not protrude into the main line and the owners shall provide video or photographic evidence of such.</li>
				<li>Temporary facilities including portable toilets are to be placed away from the street behind the property set back line so as not to cause an unsightly appearance.</li>
				<li>Curbs are to be constructed to City Code.</li>
				<li>Fencing or barricades on new construction projects must be five feet in height and shall be sited three feet in from where the asphalt meets the yard or landscape. Fencing or barricades shall be of mesh fabric or chain link. The fencing shall enclose the site such that it shall be secured from intrusion.</li>
				<li>For projects where the existing house is demolished (1) pest abatement must take place prior to demolition and (2) contractor/owner shall make every effort to contain dust, to include sprinkler or spraying of water.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1>Board Policy - March 1999</h1>
			<ol>
				<li><p>The Board shall implement procedures which require actual notice to adjacent neighbors (disregarding streets) who may be affected by a proposed construction project which alters an existing roofline.</p></li>
				<li><p>The Board shall adopt a procedural process for review of proposed construction projects which alter an existing roofline.  Included would be notice to adjacent neighbors (disregarding streets) and the right of such neighbors to review all proposed plans, the right of such neighbors who object to the proposed project as well as the applicant to present to the Board their reasons for opposition to or in support of the proposed project, the right of each party to present to the Board its response to the other’s initial submission for or against the proposed project and the requirement that the board provide its reasons for its decision to approve or reject the proposed project.</p></li>
				<li><p>In the event the proposed project alters an existing roofline, the Board shall require that the applicant erect a roof ridge pole or similar mechanism which reasonably and accurately displays the change in the existing roof ridge line.  The roof ridge pole shall be erected prior to the requirement of either applicant or opponent to submit materials to the Board</p></li>
				<li><p>The Board shall consider any and all objections presented to the Board by homeowners potentially affected by proposed construction that alters and existing roofline.  The parties also shall address how they believe the project affects the best interests of the community.  If the Board believes its decision may be based on matters not addressed by the parties, it shall so advise the parties and afford them the opportunity to be heard.  The Board shall consider the evidence submitted to it supporting the interests of the applicant and that of any opponents, and the Board shall consider what is in the best interest of the community, in deciding whether to approve or reject such a proposed construction project.  The Board shall document its decision which shall be reasonable and in good faith.  The decision shall remain in the sound discretion of the Board.</p></li>
