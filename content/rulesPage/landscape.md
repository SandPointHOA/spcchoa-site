sections:
  - secBody: "The Board of Directors of the Sand Point Homeowners Association,
      pursuant to the authority vested in the Board by Section 10.2(m) of the
      Bylaws, hereby adopts the following rules and regulations regarding the
      construction of certain landscaping features on Lots in the Sand Point
      community:"
  - secBody: Several owners in the Sand Point community have, as part of their
      applications for approval of landscaping plans, proposed to include
      “hardscape features” such as low retaining walls, small monument signs for
      their names and/or street addresses, or merely as decorative additions to
      the vegetation in their landscaping.  The Board of Directors has
      determined that such features may, if properly designed, scaled and
      located, be appropriate and consistent with the quality of the community
      aesthetics which the Board strives to achieve and will promote the safe
      use of the private streets and rights of way in the community.  This
      Resolution adopts guidelines for the design and construction of such
      landscaping features.
    secHeader: Background Information
  - secBody: "Subject to Board approval in accordance with the Construction Approval
      Process, Owner shall be permitted to construct, as part of their  street
      facing landscaping, a low hardscape feature (i.e., a non-vegetative
      structure which may or may not include a name or street address component)
      which complies with the following standards:\ 


      1. The feature may be no taller than 30 inches above the grade of
      the surrounding yard.  If the feature is proposed to be located on a berm
      or other landscaping component, the Board shall have the discretion to
      disallow the feature or require that the total height of the feature be
      limited.\ 

      2. The horizontal length of the feature (i.e., the length of the
      feature parallel to the street) may not exceed the width of the yard to
      the point of the applicable side yard setback (i.e. five (5) or ten (10)
      feet from property line).

      3. The depth of the feature (i.e., the distance from the front
      facing the street to the back of the feature away from the street) may not
      exceed 30 inches.\ 

      4. The feature shall be located at least 24 inches away from in back
      of or behind the edge of the street right-of-way (property
      line).  Note:  The edge of the street right-of-way is not the edge of the
      paved street surface.

      5. The feature should be made of stone, wood or other natural
      materials. The Board shall have the discretion to approve the use of all
      materials used on a case by case basis.

      6. The feature may include the name of the residents and/or the
      street address of the home, but may not include any other signage.

      7. The feature may be illuminated subject to the following:\ 

      \   1. Illumination shall be directed at the feature and away from
      the street and neighboring properties.\ 

      \   2. The level of illumination shall not result in glare or levels
      of brightness which the Board determines may affect neighbors or persons
      traveling on the streets in the community. \ 

      \   3. Because the level of illumination and the impact of lights on
      other properties is difficult to evaluate in advance of actual
      construction, the Board shall retain the authority, after installation of
      the feature, to require that illumination be modified to mitigate impacts
      on the other properties and persons.\r\r
