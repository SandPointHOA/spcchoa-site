      Subject to RCW 64.38.055, the following are general guidelines for the
      installation of Solar Panels:


      Solar Panel installation plans must be submitted to the SPHOA Board for approval a minimum of 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled Board meeting.  Submittal documents must include the name of the vendor performing the installation and the drawings/documents submitted to the City of Seattle for the permitting process.


      Panels may be installed on roofs with the following provisions:


      1. Panels must follow the slope of the roof

      2. Panels may not be visible above the roof line

      3. The top edge of the panels must be parallel to the roof ridge

      4. Panel frame, support brackets, wiring and piping may be required to be painted or otherwise finished to coordinate with the roofing material color


      Ground mounted panels may be installed with the following provisions:


      1. Panels and parts (e.g., frame, support brackets, wiring and piping)  must be entirely within the boundaries of the applicable setbacks

      2. Panels must be screened/shielded so as not to be visible to neighboring properties

      3. Panels or support structures may not be higher than the bottom edge of the homeâ€™s roof


      As part of the plan review and approval process, the SPHOA Board of Directors may impose other reasonable requirements in relationship to the placement and manner of the solar panels.
