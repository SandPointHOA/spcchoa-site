In honor of our Sand Point Country Club neighborhood 2020 high school and college graduates, there will be a socially-distanced neighborhood GRAD PARADE THIS SUNDAY, MAY 31st at 4:00pm.

We are hoping to get maximum participation from the neighborhood to celebrate these grads as many of them may not get the opportunity to participate in an official graduation march at their high schools or universities. All neighbors are encouraged to come out to their porches or front yards when they hear the Graduation March and cheer on our grads as the parade passes by. The Grad Parade route will start at the entrance and cruise the outer loop heading towards the club, next the inner loop via Crest Dr. and then Forest Dr., finally along Ridge Drive and end at Triangle Park. We will end there with a socially distanced traditional cap throw and photos taken of the grads and their families.

Thank you and congratulations to our SPCC neighborhood 2020 high school and college graduates!
