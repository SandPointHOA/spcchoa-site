Hi Neighbors,

Sand Point West Triangle Park will host Theo's Gyros Food Truck this Thursday, June 25, from 4 PM to 8 PM.  SPCC has Tunes on the Terrace on Friday, so Thursday works best for the food truck this week.

Theo's Gyros menu can be found at https://www.theosgyrosseattle.com/.  They will be offering everything on their menu except their soups, which are only offered during fall and winter months.  They will have canned sodas and bottled water.  Theo's accepts cash, credit card, tap to pay, Apple pay, and Google pay.  

Thanks,  Jim Na
