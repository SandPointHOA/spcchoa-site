Thank you, neighbors and friends, for sharing your thoughts and concerns regarding the temporary closure of roads amidst the COVID-19 outbreak and heavy equipment usage.We sincerely value the different opinions of all community members.We’re in unprecedented times, facing a life-threatening global pandemic and we are all having to make changes to mitigate further spread.

Following the recommendations and actions by state and local officials to promote social distancing, combined with the restart of construction on the golf course, the Board of Directors has decided to temporarily close the roads in the community to foot and bike traffic from non-residents.Additionally, we are asking our residents to use the inner loop for walking/cycling during the day during this two-week period of heavy equipment trucks on Lakemont and Fairway. We received an email from Ridgetop Golf (the construction company), they were given permission to finish the golf course in a short two-week window.Their email also stated they were finding it increasingly difficult to move around the roads with the increase in pedestrian and bicycle traffic.None of us want to see an accident occur.We continue to have conversations with SPCC club management and they agreed on April 15, 2020, to halt construction by 5pm and will not work on the weekends. **Residents may now walk/cycle on Lakemont and Fairway after 5pm and on weekends.**

As this is a very fluid situation, we will continue to evaluate the actions we have taken and provide updates on our SPCCHOA website.We are truly lucky to call this neighborhood our home – both for the beautiful location and the wonderful people in our community.Thank you for your cooperation.
