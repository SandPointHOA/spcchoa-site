Greetings Neighbors,

The Sand Point Homeowners Association is asking all residents to participate in deciding when to open our roads again to non-residents after the closure that was put in place.  This will be done using an online tool called SurveyMonkey to capture the vote. The link to SurveyMonkey will be emailed on Monday, April 27, 2020 to all current homeowners.  The voting period will be open from Monday, April 27 through Wednesday, April 29th at 9:00 PM.  \[](<>)
