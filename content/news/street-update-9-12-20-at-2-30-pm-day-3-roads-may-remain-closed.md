Hi Neighbors,

All three streets worked on yesterday (Ridge, Crown, and Fairway) will remain closed with another evaluation at Noon. The seal coating has not dried sufficiently. Check here ([spcchoa.com](http://spcchoa.com/)) for updates.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

Hi Neighbors,

We can already determine that the streets done today will not be ready for cars tonight. If you are walking to your house please watch for areas that look wet and don't step in those. The cones/tape will be removed at 7am tomorrow.

Thanks for understanding and staying off the streets!

Hi Neighbors,

The weather has not been favorable today for quick drying of the seal coat being applied to Crown, Ridge and a section of Fairway. There is a chance we will need to keep these sections closed overnight. We will make a determination at 7:00pm as to whether we reopen at 9:00 tonight or 7:00 tomorrow morning. We will send another email around 7:00pm to let you know. Driving on these roads before they are dry will do a lot of damage to the seal coat and will be expensive to re-do.

Thanks for your cooperation.
