Hi Neighbors,

The weather has not been favorable today for quick drying of the seal coat being applied to Crown, Ridge and a section of Fairway. There is a chance we will need to keep these sections closed overnight. We will make a determination at 7:00pm as to whether we reopen at 9:00 tonight or 7:00 tomorrow morning. We will send another email around 7:00pm to let you know. Driving on these roads before they are dry will do a lot of damage to the seal coat and will be expensive to re-do.

Thanks for your cooperation.
