## DIRECTOR REPORTS

**Sewer** – Joe informed the homeowners that the Board had retained an outside engineering firm to advise the SPMC on the best course of action to maintain and improve the sewer system. Joe introduced Laurie Pfarr from LPD Engineering and Laurie presented the initial findings from a comprehensive sewer survey. Per Laurie, SPMC owned main sewer lines were videotaped, and the results show that the sewer system is operational and functioning well given its age. The biggest issues relate to lack of slope in the lines and a deterioration of clay tile pipes. The next steps will be to prepare a matrix of priorities for the next 1, 3 and 5 years as well as estimated costs that the Board can use for planning purposes. Joe Flick reminded the homeowners that lateral lines are the homeowner’s responsibility and maintenance of lines is strongly recommended, including video of line to ensure that the line is impeded by roots and/or is on the brink of breaking.

**Security** – Margaret Day presented the security report on behalf of Anita Hearl. The report summarized the past year’s crime stats which included packages stolen from porches, car prowls and a theft of tools from a home under construction.  Reminder that SPD is your first point of contact unless it is something a security guard can handle when on duty 8pm-4am. Johnny works Tues-Sat and Michael Sun and Mon. We have 7 day a week security. Security alerts are currently going out by email. If you have not received a notice in the past year, please email Joe Flick to be put on the list.

SPMC is installing Flock Security wireless cameras at the entrance that are guaranteed to get license plates within 75' and at a speed of 55 MPH. Installation is scheduled within the next 2 weeks. 

The 2018 security budget was $47,000. Actuals were under budget at $44,544 due to not needing extra staffing.  Our cost sharing arrangement with SPCC is unchanged. SPMC pays 68% of all security expenses. SPCC pays 32%. 

The last security survey was done in 2014. We are in the process of doing another survey to determine what the residents want if any in ways of improvement and/or change. The goal is to do this every 5 years. Based on survey results, the Board will review current security protocols.

**Parks** – John Baughn presented overview of 2018.  West Triangle Park owned by SMPC and normal maintenance was incurred in 2018 as well as some one-time services for storm clean-up.  East Triangle Park (ETP) is owned by SPCC.  SPCC is considering options to ETP that could help reduce the congestion on Lakemont from the gate house to the end ETP.  The street is 22-23’ wide and when cars are parked on the street it’s a narrow gap.  As such, John is overseeing a project to look at alternatives to alleviate congestion including cutting into the park to widen the street, creating parking by cutting into the park and/or some combination of the above.  SPCC is also looking to improve the aesthetics of the ETP.  The project plan for ETP is a work in progress and the parking stall creation idea has been met with mixed reviews and the SPMC will work with SPCC to ensure that homeowners have a say in any future plans for ETP.

**Treasurer** – Margaret Day reported that 2018 actual were $127,384 favorable to budget by $6,506.  The 2019 Operating Budget remains unchanged at $133,000 as does the 2019 Maintenance Reserve at $250/Owner.   2018 additional expenditures included $2,220 for the entry speed bumps; $2,500 for the West Triangle Park bench and stone pavers (installed 2017 and paid for in 2018); and $6,900 for video inspection of the sewer mainlines.  Brent Jones explained that a Maintenance Reserve study was conducted several years ago, and the aging roads and sewers system were the key drivers identified in needing a Maintenance Reserve of approximately $400,000 to $500,000.  It is the intent of the Board to ensure there are adequate funds for ongoing maintenance and repair of SMPC which may or may not require that the annual Maintenance Reserve assessment be continued after reaching the target reserve amount.

**Roads** – Mike Evans reported that in May 2018 a new speed bump was installed at the entry just East of the guard house, and tree root damage and alligator cracking on the roads were repaired by cutting and patching.  The cost of the work from the gate to clubhouse drive was split between SPMC and SPCC 68%/32%.  The cost to SPMC was $22.5K, SPCC $8.6K.  During Spring or Summer 2019, the entire SP neighborhood will be crack sealed.  This year’s crack sealing will cost $11K - $12K with SPCC picking up a prorated share of the cost of crack sealing for the road surface area between the entry gate to Clubhouse Drive.  Seal coating will occur in 3-4 years.  Crack sealing and seal coating the roads alternate on a 3-4 year cycle.  Seal coating is more disruptive and will probably cost $50K - $65K.  If we maintain the roads with crack sealing and seal coating we can postpone the next repaving project for another 15 years.

During 2018 stop stripes were added to Ridge at the Ridge / Crown intersection.  The speed limit within SP was reduced from 20 mph to 15 mph but speeding is still a problem along Lakemont and Ridge.  To reduce the speeding problem, more speed humps and landscaped intersection island / small traffic circles may be considered.  SPMC plans to hire a traffic consultant to advise on the best course of action.

**Buildings** - Mike Evans reported that there were six Construction Application Process applications approved during 2018.  Applications included: Boyds, 8042 Crest Dr.; Hedin, 7535 Fairway Dr.; Lord, 8212 Crest Dr.; Cohen, 8010 Ridge Dr.; Reddy, 7516 Fairway Dr.; and McKee, 7772 Fairway Dr. All are in various stages of construction at this time except the Cohen residence.  No start at the Cohen residence yet.

_Miscellaneous items_ - The City of Seattle has not yet decided what to do with the fire hydrant on Fairway that is being engulfed by the big redwood tree.  There has been a work order in place for over a year.  The decision involves the city arborists.  Most likely the existing hydrant will be left in place, bypassed, and a new hydrant on installed nearby.

SPMC and SCL are determining who owns the light poles in the neighborhood.  Originally we were told our old fixtures would be replaced with new more efficient LED fixtures when SCL crews were available.  The issue of who pays for the fixture replacement surfaced a few months ago.  Once the LED fixtures are installed our cost/pole/month will be cut in half.  If we are required to pay for the new LED fixtures the payback period given the reduced rate would be about 8 years.

**PM Report** – Joe Flick requests that if a street light is out, call Seattle City Light or call him. Children should not play on the golf course and issues should be reported to the SPCC General Manager.  Golf carts may only be driven by licensed drivers.  Catch basis are the responsibility of homeowner—please clean them out if you have one in front of your house.

**President’s Report** – Brent Jones shared that a project is underway to develop a secure website for the SPMC Homeowner’s Association. Notifications, building regulations, rules, calendars and contact information are a few of the features that will be available.

Brent thanked the outgoing Board members for their years of service and their contributions to the SPMC HOA Board.  The outgoing Board members are John Baughn, Cory Benson and Kevin Sutherland.

There was no additional business, the meeting adjourned at **5:30 pm**.

Respectfully submitted, Margaret Day Board Treasurer
