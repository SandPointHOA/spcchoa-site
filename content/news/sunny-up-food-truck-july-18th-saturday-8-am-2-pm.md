Hi Neighbors,

I hope everyone had a great weekend! Another great week of food trucks! I’m mixing it up this week with a breakfast/brunch food truck called Sunny Up! They will have a little modified menu to make things quicker but will still have a great menu to pick from. Below is a link to the sandwiches they will be serving along with some extras – hash brown patty, donut holes, yogurt w/ granola. They will also have Anchorhead drip coffee and cold brew!

Sunny Up will be in SPCC Triangle Park this Saturday, July 18th from 8 AM to 2 PM.

Thanks,

Jim Na
