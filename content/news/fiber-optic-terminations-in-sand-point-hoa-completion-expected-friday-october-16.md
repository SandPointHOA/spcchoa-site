Hi Neighbors,

Based on the email below, Xfinity is tentatively going to start phase two of the fiber optic (FO) project in our neighborhood and complete the cutover on Friday, October 16. Phase one was to install the underground conduit and FO cables. Phase two is to terminate the new FO cable and connect some FO to coaxial interface electronics. The coaxial cable going to our homes will remain undisturbed in most cases. In this phase the roads will not be torn up.

Please watch for the Xfinity note at your door so you are not surprised by the service interruption.

Hello Mike,

We have added your neighborhood, to our SPLICING/UPGRADE schedule.

Tentative work date is for Friday, Oct-16th. We plan to splice the entire neighborhood that day.

You will soon be seeing additional SEFNCO trucks coming into , to splice/activate the Fiber Optic cables. Once this is done, other trucks will come in and certify the Four nodes.

The final stage of the UPGRADE, will happen on the Friday Oct.-16th, where we will transfer all homes to the upgraded system.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks.

Mel
