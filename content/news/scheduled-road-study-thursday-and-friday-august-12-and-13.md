Hi Neighbors,

On Thursday and Friday of this week (August 12 and 13), Robinson Nobel Inc. will be working on our roads at Fairway Drive, Ridge Drive, and Lakemont Drive at previously marked locations.  They are taking core samples of our roads to determine their health.  Coring and a temporary patch will be done on Thursday and a final asphalt patch will be done on Friday.  Work areas will be marked with cones.

Thank you.

Your SPHOA Board
