RE: Safety concerns

As we all know we are in the midst of a national health crisis that has shuttered businesses, closed schools and sent workers and children home. With the good weather upon us and school suspended, there are at any given time of the day 50 to 100 people walking the loop or gathering in the parks. As a reminder to all, please practice “social distancing” and stay up to speed on what you should know about Covid-19 by visiting:

Ridgetop Development is nearing completion of the SPCC golf course renovation. It is anticipated that this project will wrap up in the next two weeks. To date, Ridgetop has had an excellent safety record. They would like to keep it that way. In the coming two weeks we can expect a high volume of heavy equipment and large trucks rolling through our streets, particularly on LAKEMONT DRIVE between the MAIN ENTRANCE and HOETMER DRIVE. If you are walking the streets, keep your head on a swivel and maybe turn off the cell phone. Be safe out there.

Be advised that Hoetmer Drive is being restricted to pedestrians at this time.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
