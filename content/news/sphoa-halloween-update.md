At our last board meeting on Oct. 15 we clarified a couple of items on Halloween and wanted to pass those along.

·         We will be placing signs out front a week before explaining that we are discouraging trick or treating this year. 

·         We will place a notice on Nextdoor Sandpoint saying that trick or treating is discouraged this year in SPCC.

·         We will be having two security guards that night starting at 5pm.  

Our goal is to minimize the droves of trick-or-treaters this year to help comply with the guidelines designed to mitigate Covid-19.

We have polled various residents in the neighborhood and the plans for Halloween run the gamut .... from some not participating at all to others wanting their small kids to walk to some neighboring homes. Of those participating, some are just buying 100 pieces of candy, some just handing out candy between 5:30-6:30pm, and others setting out a bowl or tray of candy in their walkway. 

If you do not want to participate, turn off your porch light.  If you think it would help, post a sign. A sample can be found at:  <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SEut0FqCdJRSJHoEaOf29Rm2B1tQlsjm/view?usp=sharing>. 

If anyone is interested in coordinating a safe neighborhood event (e.g., parade, pumpkin carving, etc.) please contact a board member, so we can help publicize the activity. 

Everyone will do what is most comfortable for them. We hope you all have a safe and Happy Halloween!
