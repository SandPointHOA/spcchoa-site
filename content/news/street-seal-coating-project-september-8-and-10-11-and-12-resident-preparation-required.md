Hi Neighbors,

The street seal coating project is scheduled for September 10th through September 12th (weather dependent). In addition, we have scheduled a street sweeper to come in on Tuesday, September 8th, around 10 am. All streets will be swept on this day.

The map that shows which streets are being worked on each day can be found at this link: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eph23F-47FPRsXSiwt00SQanyYBnio9p/view?usp=sharing>

**Homeowner Responsibilities:**

* Vehicles moved from roads during street sweeping and seal coating
* Cut/trim all foliage, weeds, and grass at edge of street and driveways
* Turn front yard sprinkler systems off the night before seal coating and keep off the next day

All vehicles MUST be moved off the streets the night before seal coating work starts on an affected street. Once work is completed for the day, cars cannot be moved back **until 9PM** to give the seal coat time to cure. PLEASE – NO BIKES, SKATEBOARDS, GOLF CARTS, SCOOTERS, ETC. **NOTE**: Any vehicles left on the affected streets will be towed at the owner’s expense.

Please coordinate with your construction crews, landscapers and other vendors to let them know what day they will not have direct access to your house on the day of street sweeping (9/8/20) and the day your street is being worked on.

The HOA board requests you cut/trim all foliage, weeds and grass that grow at the edge of the asphalt and your curb/driveway as this will prevent the seal coat from covering the entire street. We request that you actually edge the grass a couple of inches away from the asphalt. If this is not done by the homeowner, the HOA will hire a landscaper to do it. We highly recommend that you perform the work as the landscaper might not execute the way you would like it done!

Affordable Asphalt crews will start each workday power brushing and blowing off the roads. There may be some dirt or small bits of debris that blow into a yard. The HOA will have a street sweeper come in on September 8th to reduce the amount of dirt on the streets. Detour signs and road signs will be set up as necessary.

**What to expect from the seal coat project:**

* Oil Spots – As part of the service, oil spots are scraped and primed for better adhesion of the seal coat. Note that there can be some lifting or separation of the sealer, if a car’s tire parks directly on an old oil spot.
* Power Steering Marks – Seal coat is very tender during the first 30 days. As cars back out and the tire turns in place, the seal coat will scuff. These marks will mat back in over the next 30 days.
* White Residue – When water comes in contact with freshly laid sealer, a white calcium residue sometimes forms. It has no lasting effects.

Please check the website during the project for any additional updates.  Thank you for your cooperation!
