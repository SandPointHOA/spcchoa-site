To all Residents:

Effective Monday, 4/13/20 and until further notice, the Sand Point Maintenance Commission Board of Directors is closing our community to all non-resident pedestrians and cyclists due to Covid-19 combined with safety concerns due to the completion of the final phase of the golf course renovation. There will be a new modified sign to that effect posted at the gatehouse. The club will provide personnel at the gatehouse who will hand out flyers advising all outside pedestrians and cyclists attempting to come in from 7am - 4pm the neighborhood is temporarily closed. 

This final phase includes heavy construction vehicles moving between Lakemont and Fairway carrying loads of bunker sand and sod. The sole purpose of the outer loop being closed is to keep all of our residents safe. We will reopen the outer loop when the construction is complete.

Due to the golf course construction, Lakemont and Fairway will be closed to **ALL** pedestrians and cyclists including residents.

**PLEASE STAY OFF THE OUTER LOOP UNTIL CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETED AS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.**

*The Contractor will be working during the days/evenings/weekends in order to complete the project as quickly as possible.*

We are asking all homeowners on Ridge, Crest and Forest to remove their cars from the streets. These streets will be heavily traveled during this closure making social distancing and driving even that much more difficult (please park on NE 75th if there is no off-street parking available).

***Please note: it is not the responsibility of residents to police the streets and/or confront people~~.~~***

Finally, with the warmer weather coming and daylight hours lengthening, we are reminding all to obey the Governor's mandate for sheltering in place and social distancing. This of course means no gatherings so that our community can remain healthy, safe and get us back to normal sooner.
