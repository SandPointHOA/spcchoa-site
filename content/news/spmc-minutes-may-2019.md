## ADMINISTRATIVE:

1. Minutes of April 25, 2019 Board meeting were reviewed and approved.
2. Discussed alternate parking for Club staff, as many have been parking on Lakemont.  It was suggested by Club management that both Anita and Joe approved this, but there was neither a motion nor approval by the SPMC.  The SPCC (Owen  Westerveld GM and Ryann Day Pres.) were of the opinion that this was always the way it has been.  It is not.
3. SPMC Website:  Peggie and Joe conferenced with Jordan Smith, website developer of our community website to discuss format and content.  
4. Discussed AirBnB and other rentals.  Margaret moves SPMC create regulation prohibiting short term rentals.  Peggie seconds. All approve.
5. Discussed storage units in setback on residents’ driveways.
6. Currently our security hourly staffing charge is $20.65 per hour.  New rate will be $23.64.
7. Prepare community survey to determine whether residents are content with current security, or would suggest increased hours or other measures.  Survey can be sent out via email blast and/or be posted on our community website along with information such as schedule for crack sealing, prohibition of short term rentals, restrictions regarding PODS or other storage containers, etc. 
8. Ryann Day has agreed to construct off street parking in his front yard providing the light standard be moved to adjacent neighbor to the East. Locating across street is impractical.
9. PM ordered replacement lights for Radar traffic sign

## ENTRY

Sidewalks and landscape rocks to be power washed.

## SECURITY

FLOCK Security cameras were adjusted to the proper field of view.

## SEWER

Ongoing: Lauri Pharr with LPD is reviewing the data provided by APS from their 2018 sewer video survey.  LPD will utilize this data in preparing a long-range plan and will advise us on which repairs should be done and when. Getting vendor bids for the various locations.

## BUILDINGS

No Report. 

## ROADS

1. Cracks in the roadway will be addressed in spring 2019.  SPCC has provided blackout dates.  Mike is scheduling.
2. Asphalt repair needed in front of 7746 Ridge.  
3. TransProGroup (traffic control consultants) contract submitted for approval.  Contract to include “tube counters” that will record the number of vehicles entering The SPCC.  A second tube counter will be positioned on Lakemont and Hoetmer Drive and will record the number of vehicles that access the Clubhouse.  This data will put SPMC in a better position when we discuss percentage splits between SPCC & SPMC as it regards future road over-lay and crack sealing.
4. PM met Seattle Fire Department at the fire hydrant on Fairway Drive that has been enveloped by the Giant Sequoia. Their proposal is to abandon the existing hydrant and install a new unit approximately 15’ to the South.  The line will then be rerouted around the root structure of the tree and continue North.  Asphalt will need to be cut out and restored. This project is being overseen by the Engineering Department and no start date has been established.

## PARKS

John Martin Services re-seeded the WTP, applied starter fertilizer, a top dressing and then cordoned off the park until grass takes root.  SPCC aerated prior to the over-seeding.

## VIOLATIONS

1. PODS:  Dan Fisher non-responsive. After regulation regarding storage units has been added to bylaws, he will be contacted and informed.
2. When identified, repeated speed violators will be reported to SPCC Club Manager for warnings.

## NEW BUSINESS

Charlie discussed recent communications with City Light regarding street lighting. It was determined that the street lights ARE the property of City Light, not the Sand Point HOA.  The various issues we have can best be resolved within their organization by a consultant with contacts and the ability to facilitate solutions on our behalf.  We may hire this consultant after reviewing a bid outlining the cost.
