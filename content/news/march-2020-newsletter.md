MARCH 2020 NEWSLETTER
 
Hello Homeowners!  Welcome to our community Newsletter. In an effort to keep our members up to speed on current events in the neighborhood, this Newsletter will be updated monthly.  A lot has been going on since our last HOA meeting. Here is a brief updateâ€¦  
 

1.	Traffic Safety:
After receiving complaints about vehicles exceeding the posted 15 mph speed
limit and vehicles not slowing down or stopping when coming to an intersection,
the Board has elected to paint four way STOP signs at all four way intersections.
This spring or early summer the following intersections will have a white line
and the word STOP painted on them: The south end intersection of Crest/Forest
and Ridge, the north end intersection of Crest/Forest and Ridge, the Forest and
Crown intersection and the Crest and Crown intersection.
 
2.	Fiber Optic Cable
Fiber optic cable is coming to Sand Point.  Comcast would like to install high speed
fiber optic cable underground to increase internet speed. We are just getting
started on this project and will have more information to you next month.
 
3.  Capital Reserve Study
The Board is updating our Capital Reserve Study to further assess future repairs
and upgrades that should be accrued for. This study has proven beneficial
and will be taken into consideration during our budgeting process.
 
4.  Road Seal Coating
We have met with asphalt companies for input on how to increase our roads
longevity.  In addition to crack sealing, it has been recommended that a two-part
seal coating be applied every 5 years. This should give us another 10 to 15 years
before resurfacing is needed. Seal coating will be applied in 2022.  Crack sealing
was completed in October, 2019.  

     5.  Private Sewer System
	We have just completed the cleaning and video scope of our entire sewer system.  Repairs have been identified, prioritized and are now being scheduled.

     6.  Web Site
Our community web site is up and running. If you need some assistance in navigating the site or your information as it appears in the Directory section is missing or incorrect, please email your concern to our property manager Joe Flick at JoeFlick@comcast.net.

     6.  Board Positions & Meetings
The Board of Directors meets every third Thursday of the month.  Meetings begin at 6:30 PM and held at the SPCC.  Three Board positions will need to be filled next year. Please let us know if you would consider volunteering.
