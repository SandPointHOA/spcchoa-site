Please join us for a socially-distanced bike and golf cart parade this Saturday in celebration of the 4th of July! Meet just before 10:00am at Triangle Park with your carts and bikes pre-decorated with your finest and most spectacular red, white and blue decor. We will head out from the park promptly at 10:00am for a parade through the neighborhood. Everyone is invited to join in the fun – if you don’t plan to be a part of the parade, we encourage you all to come to your front yard or porch to cheer on the parade-goers as they ride by. Our route will be along the outer loop, then inner loop, then down Ridge Drive, ending back at Triangle Park for a special treat and/or surprise.

Please remember to socially distance, stay safe and have a happy, healthy 4th of July – we look forward to seeing you all on Saturday!
