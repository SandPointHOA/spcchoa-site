      Welcome to the Sand Point Country Club! We are glad you have decided to
      locate your family in this unique neighborhood.


      Because this is a private development, there are certain restrictions on
      Residential Construction Projects that you will not find in the Zoning or
      Building Codes of the City of Seattle. The enforcement of the Bylaws and
      Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&R’s) rests with the Board of
      Directors of the Sand Point Maintenance Commission (SPMC). A guiding
      principle for the Board is that it acts in what it considers to be the
      best interests of the Sand Point Community. In matters such as
      construction projects that require a formal vote of the Board, this is
      determined by a majority of a quorum of the Board members present when the
      voting occurred. The Board’s authority is spelled out in this document,
      which contains excerpts from our Bylaws and CC&R’s. In addition to the
      Sand Point Community’s requirements for construction projects, you also
      must apply to the City of Seattle for your building permits and comply
      with the city building codes.


      If you are contemplating a construction project, please take a few minutes
      to familiarize yourself with the process outlined herein so that your
      project can go as smoothly as possible.

      The SPMC Bylaws and CC&R’s provide that:


      1. No building shall be erected, maintained or permitted upon any of said
      tracts except single, detached, private dwelling house, for the sole use
      of the owners or occupants thereof, for private residence purposes
      together with appurtenant garage.

      2. No building, fence, wall or structure shall be erected, altered or
      maintained upon any of said tracts, unless plans and specifications
      therefor, showing the construction, nature, kind, shape, height, material
      and color scheme therefor, and block plan indicating the location of such
      structure on the building site and, when specifically requested, the
      grading plans of the building site, to be built upon, shall have been
      submitted to, and approved in writing by the said Commission, and a copy
      of such plans and specifications, block plan (and grading plan if
      requested) as finally approved, deposited for permanent record with the
      said Commission.

      3. The Board of Directors... shall have, among others, the following
      powers ... to interpret and enforce any and all protective restrictions,
      conditions, covenants, and reservations imposed upon any of said tracts by
      either of such owners...


      The CC&R’s require that the Board must review, consider and approve or
      disapprove all proposed construction projects. In order for the Board to
      approve the construction project, you must submit the attached
      “Application for Approval of Construction” form along with a set of
      construction documents, to the Board’s Building Commissioner no less than
      thirty (30) days prior to the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting.


      For simple construction projects that will not alter an existing roofline
      of a structure (e.g. the addition of a deck, minor interior modifications,
      etc.), the proposed project will typically be reviewed and a determination
      made by the Board at the first regularly scheduled Board meeting following
      receipt of the required documentation.


      If a construction project will alter the existing roofline of a structure,
      the particular steps and time requirements for approval are as follows:


      1. **Ridge Poles:** Erect ridge poles to represent the height of the new
      structure. Ridge poles must be in place for a minimum of thirty (30) days
      prior to the SPMC Board meeting at which the plans will be submitted for
      approval (the “_Approval Meeting_”).

      2. **City Approval:** Submit plans to the City of Seattle. Plans must have
      been submitted for the permit process prior to providing plans to the SPMC
      Building Commissioner (Step 4, below).

      3. **Neighbor Contact:** Contact each adjacent neighbor (all sides) and
      present plans and form for signature. Neighbors must be contacted at least
      twenty-five (25) days prior to the Approval Meeting. Contact may be made
      in person, by mail or by e-mail. The plans and signature form must be
      included in the mailing or the e-mail. If unable to contact a neighbor,
      document the attempt by sending a certified letter containing the plans
      and forms.

      4. **SPMC Application:** Fill out, sign and return SPMC construction
      application forms. Forms are available from the SPMC Building
      Commissioner. The SPMC Building Commissioner must receive the plans,
      signed application and signed neighbor forms a minimum of twenty (20) days
      prior to the Approval Meeting. If a neighbor does not return the signature
      form to the applicant and no written objection is received, the Board will
      consider the lack of the signed document as an approval.

      5. **Objections:** If a homeowner objects to the proposed construction
      plan, they must do so in writing to the SPMC Building Commissioner not
      less than ten (10) days prior to the Approval Meeting. Should any such
      written objection be received, the Board will consider the plans and
      objection at the Approval Meeting but will delay voting to approve or deny
      the plans until the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting. The
      applicant may respond in writing, submitted to the Board and all objecting
      homeowners no later than ten (10) days prior to the next regularly
      scheduled Board meeting, and submit any additional information or
      documentation in support of the application as well as their opinion as to
      what is in the best interest of the community.

      6. **Plan Changes:** SPMC Board approvals are limited to the particular
      construction plans submitted to the neighbors and Board. If the submitted
      plans are ultimately changed, either due to City of Seattle requirements
      or otherwise, the revised plans must be promptly re- submitted to the SPMC
      Building Commissioner. Depending on the nature and scope of the changes,
      re-approval by the SPMC Board and/or neighbors may be required.


      At the Approval Meeting, the Board shall allow the applicant and the
      objecting homeowners a reasonable opportunity to orally explain their
      project and/or objections. If the Board believes its decision may be based
      on matters not addressed by the parties in their written materials or oral
      comments, the Board shall so advise the parties and allow them a
      reasonable opportunity to respond. The Board may delay its decision for
      approval or rejection if it deems additional documentation is required
      from the applicant and/or objecting homeowners. Otherwise the Board shall
      vote at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting to approve or deny the
      application.


      The Board shall document its decision which shall be reasonable and in
      good faith. The decision shall rest in the sound discretion of the Board.

      Additions to the Construction Approval Process as approved by the Sand
      Point Maintenance Commission October 19, 1999 and amended May 15, 2001,
      March 15, 2012, May 19, 2016, and September 28, 2016:


      1. Construction is limited to the hours of 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday thru
      Friday and 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Saturday and Sunday.

      2. Construction debris on the road must be cleaned on a daily basis.

      3. Storm drains must be covered with filter fabric and kept free of
      debris.

      4. Fencing or barricades on new construction projects must be five feet in
      height and shall be sited three feet in from where the asphalt meets the
      yard or landscape. Fencing or barricades shall be of mesh fabric or chain
      link. The fencing shall enclose the site such that it shall be secured
      from intrusion.

      5. Homeowners are responsible for immediate repairs for damages to SPMC
      property as a result of their construction project.

      6. Dumpsters are to remain on the property, not on the street. Under
      extenuating circumstances and with prior written approval by the SPMC
      Board, the dumpster may be allowed to be parked on the street for a period
      of no more than two weeks.

      7. Where a new lateral sewer line connection is made into the main sewer
      line, it must be done in a professional manner such that the lateral does
      not protrude into the main line and the owners shall provide video or
      photographic evidence of such.

      8. Temporary facilities including portable toilets are to be placed away
      from the street behind the fencing or barricade so as not to cause an
      unsightly appearance.

      9. Curbs are to be constructed to City Code.

      10. For projects where the existing house is demolished (1) pest abatement
      must take place prior to demolition and (2) contractor/owner shall make
      every effort to contain dust, to include sprinkler or spraying of water.

      11. The level of illumination for exterior lighting shall not result in
      glare or levels of brightness which the Board determines may affect
      neighbors or persons traveling on the streets in the community. Because
      the level of illumination and the impact of lights on other properties is
      difficult to evaluate in advance of actual construction, the Board shall
      retain the authority, after installation of the feature, to require that
      illumination be modified to mitigate impacts on the other properties and
      persons.
